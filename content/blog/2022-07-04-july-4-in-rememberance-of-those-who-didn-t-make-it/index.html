<p>I am an extremely fortunate individual. For a year, I went to work knowing that there were those that wished to do me harm, regardless of the consequences to their freedom or the safety and security of my family, simply because I wore a uniform they didn’t like. Every day I went to work, and I got to come home to my beautiful wife and two dogs. Some were not so lucky. My friends continue to take the risk of not coming home, whether out of duty to their community and country, or because they enjoy helping those who need it most. No matter your politics, no matter your stance on law enforcement, please take some time this July Fourth, the birthday of our great nation, to remember those who didn’t get to come home, whether military or emergency services. These great, brave people, who selflessly run into battle, and who payed with their lives, so that we can shoot off fireworks. Remember those who have fought for our nation over our almost 250 year history, suffering the worst injuries imaginable, so that those who would threaten us didn’t have the chance. And remember those who began to fight 246 years ago so that we could have the debates we have now over what is right and what is wrong. To my brothers still fighting: thank you.</p>
