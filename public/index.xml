      <title>#tidytuesday 2/22/22, The Freedom index and misleading visualization</title>

      <description>This weeks tidy tuesday includes the dataset of the Freedom index produced by the Freedom House and the UN.
One of the included visualizations kind of struck me the wrong way.
Included Visualization
The y axis only goes from 85 to 100, and tells the story about how the United States’ freedom is very quickly eroding. While this does tell a story, it certaintly isn’t the entire story.</description>

      <description>For this tidy tuesday, the challenge is to recreate an original data visualization from W.E.B Du Bois. I thought I would walk through my process for recreating Challenge 2.
Here is the goal:
Original
library(curl)library(tidyverse)library(ggtext)sysfonts::font_add_google(name = &amp;quot;Public Sans&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Public&amp;quot;)showtext::showtext_auto()data &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/master/challenge/2022/challenge05/data.csv&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%janitor::clean_names()ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = free, y = year))+geom_point()+xlim(0, 3)So the goal will eventually be shade both halfs of graph using a polygon, but we need to get everything set up first.</description>

      <description>I was watching Youtube videos (as I am doing so often), and came across this video from a relatively small Mario Kart Youtuber named Bayesic. He describes in great detail how player stats in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe are calculated and used in game, and how to optimize a build and strategy through the lens of Pareto optimality. He builds a dashboard to optimize any given set of stats.</description>

      <description>First, dog tax:
Papi and Nana
Since last week we discussed interpreting a “black box” model like an XGBoost, I thought we could talk more about interpretability this week as well. Models have varying levels of interpretability and in some sense, all models are a black box to someone. To data scientists who (hopefully) know what’s going on behind the curtain, things aren’t so scary, but often stakeholders need to know how to act on the information that is gleaned from ML.</description>

      <description>Like any good nerd, I enjoy a good game. Games have rules, and learning to navigate and bend rules are what good data scientists are always trying to do. We try to take advantages of the way natural systems are built to model them in the most effective way possible. So when I saw this weeks tidy tuesday dataset, I was stoked.
First, a tad of exploratory analysis.</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Eric. I&amp;rsquo;m a data analyst for Volusia County Schools, and I have an odd array of experiences.
Originally, I&amp;rsquo;m from Auburndale, Florida, where I grew up and attended high school. I moved to DeLand, Florida, in 2015 to attend Stetson University. At Stetson I studied Economics, but was most interested in Applied Statistics and prediction modelling. At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know there was such a thing as &amp;ldquo;machine learning&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure if I did I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have cared anyway, since I was enamored by a lovely young lady named Abigail, who I eventually married.</description>

      <description>In my household, we go through a lot of chocolate. Having a pregnant wife severely increases the amount of sweets in the house, and sympathy weight gain is very real. This weeks Tidy Tuesday has man interesting features. Let’s start exploring.

      <title>Not So Standard Analysis</title>
      <link>https://ericcollins.info/blog/2022-01-29-not-so-standard-analysis/</link>

      <description>I was listening to another podcast (Your Mom’s House), and another Eric, (who also happens to be another public-education data analyst) submitted an analysis of the episodes using transcripts of the episode. I wanted to add some language processing to my repertoire, so I decided to perform a similar analysis for my favorite podcast, Not-so-Standard Deviations.
As previously mentioned, I borrowed heavily from Eric Ekholme’s analysis of Your Mom’s House, which can be found at his website.</description>
