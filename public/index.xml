      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Eric. I&amp;rsquo;m a data analyst for Volusia County Schools, and I have an odd array of experiences.
Originally, I&amp;rsquo;m from Auburndale, Florida, where I grew up and attended high school. I moved to DeLand, Florida, in 2015 to attend Stetson University. At Stetson I studied Economics, but was most interested in Applied Statistics and prediction modelling. At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know there was such a thing as &amp;ldquo;machine learning&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure if I did I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have cared anyway, since I was enamored by a lovely young lady named Abigail, who I eventually married.</description>

      <description>In my household, we go through a lot of chocolate. Having a pregnant wife severely increases the amount of sweets in the house, and sympathy weight gain is very real. This weeks Tidy Tuesday has man interesting features. Let’s start exploring.

      <title>Not So Standard Analysis</title>

      <description>I was listening to another podcast (Your Mom’s House), and another Eric, (who also happens to be another public-education data analyst) submitted an analysis of the episodes using transcripts of the episode. I wanted to add some language processing to my repertoire, so I decided to perform a similar analysis for my favorite podcast, Not-so-Standard Deviations.
As previously mentioned, I borrowed heavily from Eric Ekholme’s analysis of Your Mom’s House, which can be found at his website.</description>
