      <description>I was watching Youtube videos (as I am doing so often), and came across this video from a relatively small Mario Kart Youtuber named Bayesic. He describes in great detail how player stats in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe are calculated and used in game, and how to optimize a build and strategy through the lens of Pareto optimality. He builds a dashboard to optimize any given set of stats.</description>

      <description>First, dog tax:
Papi and Nana
Since last week we discussed interpreting a “black box” model like an XGBoost, I thought we could talk more about interpretability this week as well. Models have varying levels of interpretability and in some sense, all models are a black box to someone. To data scientists who (hopefully) know what’s going on behind the curtain, things aren’t so scary, but often stakeholders need to know how to act on the information that is gleaned from ML.</description>

      <description>Like any good nerd, I enjoy a good game. Games have rules, and learning to navigate and bend rules are what good data scientists are always trying to do. We try to take advantages of the way natural systems are built to model them in the most effective way possible. So when I saw this weeks tidy tuesday dataset, I was stoked.
First, a tad of exploratory analysis.</description>

      <description>In my household, we go through a lot of chocolate. Having a pregnant wife severely increases the amount of sweets in the house, and sympathy weight gain is very real. This weeks Tidy Tuesday has man interesting features. Let’s start exploring.

      <title>Not So Standard Analysis</title>

      <description>I was listening to another podcast (Your Mom’s House), and another Eric, (who also happens to be another public-education data analyst) submitted an analysis of the episodes using transcripts of the episode. I wanted to add some language processing to my repertoire, so I decided to perform a similar analysis for my favorite podcast, Not-so-Standard Deviations.
As previously mentioned, I borrowed heavily from Eric Ekholme’s analysis of Your Mom’s House, which can be found at his website.</description>
