      <description>First, dog tax:

Since last week we discussed interpreting a “black box” model like an XGBoost, I thought we could talk more about interpretability this week as well. Models have varying levels of interpretability and in some sense, all models are a black box to someone. To data scientists who (hopefully) know what’s going on behind the curtain, things aren’t so scary, but often stakeholders need to know how to act on the information that is gleaned from ML.</description>

      <description>Like any good nerd, I enjoy a good game. Games have rules, and learning to navigate and bend rules are what good data scientists are always trying to do. We try to take advantages of the way natural systems are built to model them in the most effective way possible. So when I saw this weeks tidy tuesday dataset, I was stoked.
First, a tad of exploratory analysis.</description>
