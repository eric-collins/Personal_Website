      <description>I was listening to another podcast (Your Mom’s House), and another Eric, (who also happens to be another public-education data analyst) submitted an analysis of the episodes using transcripts of the episode. I wanted to add some language processing to my repertoire, so I decided to perform a similar analysis for my favorite podcast, Not-so-Standard Deviations.
As previously mentioned, I borrowed heavily from Eric Ekholme’s analysis of Your Mom’s House, which can be found at his website.</description>
