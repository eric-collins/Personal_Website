      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Eric. I&amp;rsquo;m a data analyst for Volusia County Schools, and I have an odd array of experiences.
Originally, I&amp;rsquo;m from Auburndale, Florida, where I grew up and attended high school. I moved to DeLand, Florida, in 2015 to attend Stetson University. At Stetson I studied Economics, but was most interested in Applied Statistics and prediction modelling. At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know there was such a thing as &amp;ldquo;machine learning&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure if I did I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have cared anyway, since I was enamored by a lovely young lady named Abigail, who I eventually married.</description>
